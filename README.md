   # Objects - objects have a type and defines the kinds of things programs can do to them
    Scalar Objects:
      These are the primitive data objects
      1. int - represent integers (1,2,3,-1)
      2. float - represent real numbers (1.2, 3.6)
      3. bool - represent Boolean ( True or False)
      4. NoneType - has only one value None
    Syntax to know the datatype of objects type(Object)
   # Type Casting: Conversion of one datatype to another
      1. float() - converts to float
      2. int() - converts to int
      3. round() - implicit function to convert to int by rounding off
   # Expression: Objets and operators combine together to form expression
      Expression has a value and type 
         1. 5+2 , has value 7 and type int
         2. 5/2 , has value 2.5 and type float
      In expression if one object is float then the value will have type float
   # Variables :
       In computer science the variable is bound to single value at a time 
       whereas in maths it could have multiple values
       By assigning variables to values we could reuse it and it improves the readability of program
       We can also rebound the variable
